I made 2 versions of hangman:

1) includes points 1-6 and comments to them.
2) is copy paste from 1st version with upgrades from points 7 to 11, with comments.

Why do I code?

My whole life I have worked in restaurants and bars.
I decided to change something in my life in 2019 and I went to the Computer Science studies. It was my first experience with c#.
I do not think I am actually coding, it is only beginings, but I would love to start coding seriously. 
I hope Motorola Solutions help me improve my skills and I will give back 100% of hard work.
